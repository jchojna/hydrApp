# hydrApp

## Project info
Simple yet useful app for daily tracking of water consumption. User can quickly get to basic app’s functionality and add (or remove) next glass of drank water what may help with not forgetting about this really important activity, especially during hot summer.. There’s also an archive section with an editable history entries divided on weeks, to have an overall insight into water consumption tendency. On top of that, user is able to change his account settings and view his or other users stats. I added some level of gamification in form of points collected by every user for 'minimum water' streaks. There is also an overall ranking of users, dynamically reacting to any change in users stats.
